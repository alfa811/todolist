#### Video Demo:  <URL https://youtu.be/IKr3rL4I1IM>
#### Description: This is a working todo list that users can access on the web. It has the ability to register and login a user. The user can enter in their choosen todos and check them when done. The app.py file is a Flask application that handles user registration, login, and managing a to-do list. It connects to an SQLite database, provides routes for registration, login, logout, and updating to-do items. It uses session management, password hashing, and helper functions. The application allows users to register, log in, view and add to-do items, mark them as done, and log out. The layout.html file utilizes jinja for making the basis of the website. Since there are two stages: before login and after login, the layout manages to display both variations. The index.html file extends a base layout and provides a form for adding new to-do items and a list of existing to-do items. The form for adding new to-do items includes an input field and a submit button. The list of existing to-do items is displayed as checkboxes, with checked boxes indicating completed items. There is also an update button to submit changes to the to-do items. The file utilizes Jinja templating to dynamically display the to-do items retrieved from the server. The register.html file provides a registration form. The form includes input fields for username, password, and confirmation. There is also a submit button for registering a new user. If there is an error message present, it is displayed in a separate div element. The file utilizes Jinja templating to dynamically display error messages if they exist. Finally, the login.html file includes input fields for username and password, as well as a submit button for logging in. The file utilizes Jinja templating to render the form within the designated content block of the base layout. The helpers.py file holds the @login_required function, which helps makes sure that the user is unable to get into the main page without registering and logging in. Last but not least, the todo.db file holds two tables. One used to get information about the user such as their username and password. Another used to store more specifics about the user. For example, it stores the todos of each user.
